My sweetest friend Everyone I know Goes away in the end You could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt I wear my crown of shit On my liar's chair Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair Beneath the stain of time The feeling disappears You are someone else I am still right here";
